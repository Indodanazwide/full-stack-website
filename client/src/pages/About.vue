                Welcome to Rendezvous Restaurant, where culinary excellence meets innovation. Nestled within the vibrant Steve Biko Campus at Durban University of Technology (DUT), Rendezvous was born from a shared passion for great food, sustainability, and student empowerment. Our story is as much about serving delicious meals as it is about fostering a space for creativity, education, and community engagement.

                <h2>Our Journey</h2>

                <p>
                    Established as a student-run restaurant by the Department of Food and Nutrition Consumer Sciences, Rendezvous began as a practical training ground for aspiring chefs and food experts. Over the years, it has evolved into a cornerstone of the campus dining experience, offering a wide range of meals carefully crafted by students and overseen by experienced faculty.

                    In 2024, we embraced a new chapter through a rebranding effort that reflects our commitment to sustainability and modern dining experiences. We introduced eco-friendly packaging and expanded our offerings to include Home Meal Replacements (HMR), perfectly suited for today’s fast-paced lifestyle. This rebranding is not just about new menus and packaging but about aligning with DUT's ENVISION 2030 strategy, which aims to foster financial sustainability and innovation.
